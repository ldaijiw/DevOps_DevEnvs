# Provisioning with Vagrant

## Gem and Bundler vs. PIP and Packages

- Gems are packages in ruby or dependencies
- Bundler is ruby's package manager
```
gem install undler
```
- Gemfile keeps a list of dependencies to be installed
	- Go to folder with Gemfile
```
bundle
```

- To install gems from Gemfile, use
```
bundle install
```

**Ruby's testing framework is rspec**

- Go to folder with Rakefile
	- Run tests with
```
rake spec
```

**JS package manager is npm (node package manager)**
